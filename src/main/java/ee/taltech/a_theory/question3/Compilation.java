    // What is compilation?
    // Answer:
    //
    // Compilation is when code is "compiled"(translated) into machine-readable language
    // Compilation can also be done from one human-readable language to another as well
    // Other than compiling, there is also transpiling - one language is being translated into other
    // and then compiled into machine code(TypeScript -> JavaScript -> machine code)
    //
    //done B
    // Name 2 benefits of compilation?
    // Benefits:
    // 1 Code takes less space when compiled
    // 2 Code can not be easily decompiled - that's why we have FOSS software and proprietary software
    // 3 Faster and more efficient compared to interpreted

    //done C
    // Name 1 disadvantage of compilation?
    // Disadvantage:
    // 1 Code can not be easily decompiled - that's why we have FOSS software and proprietary software
    // 2 platform dependence of the code generated (binary)
